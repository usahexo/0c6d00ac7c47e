#  Which countries is the casino licensed in?

A casino is a facility where games of chance are played. Casinos are most commonly built near or combined with hotels, restaurants, retail shopping, cruise ships or other tourist attractions. There is much debate over whether the social and economic effects of casino gambling outweigh the initial revenue that may be generated.

The first known casino in the world was the Ridotto, established in Venice, Italy in 1638 by the Republic of Venice to finance its war fleet. The Ridotto was closed in 1774 as the city government felt it was impoverishing the local gentry. In American history, early casinos were originally authorized by the state legislatures and operated by private entrepreneurs who leased gaming tables and machines from the proprietors of inns and other public houses. The widespread legalization of casinos in the United States came about as a result of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, which also provided for regulation of gaming operations. Licensing and regulation of casinos is typically done at the state level.

There are around 150 countries with casinos, but only around half have more than a single casino. The largest number of casinos (over 100) is found in North America, with a significant number in Europe and Asia as well. There are none (or almost none) in Africa or South America. 

The largest casino market in the world is Macau with US$44 billion in annual revenue followed by Las Vegas with US$6.5 billion.
