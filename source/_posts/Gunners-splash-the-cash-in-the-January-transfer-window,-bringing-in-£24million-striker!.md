#  Gunners splash the cash in the January transfer window, bringing in £24million striker!

Arsenal have confirmed the signing of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Borussia Dortmund for a club-record fee of £56million (€64million).

The 28-year-old Gabonese striker has joined the Gunners on a long-term contract and arrives having scored 141 goals in 213 games for Dortmund since 2013.

Aubameyang becomes Arsenal’s second signing of the January transfer window, following the arrival of Henrikh Mkhitaryan from Manchester United last month.

Speaking to arsenal.com after completing his move, Aubameyang said: “I’m really happy to be here and to join this great team. The club has such a big history and great players like Thierry Henry. He was my role model when I started playing football.

“I’m really excited to work with Arsène Wenger as well. He has a lot of experience in the Premier League and he can help me to develop as a player.”

Arsenal manager Wenger added: “He’s one of the best strikers in the world and he will add power, speed, creativity and goals to our squad. I believe he will be a great addition to our team.”

#  FA Cup Third Round: Arsenal vs Hull City – The Tigers 24 Gunners Dominate

In front of a packed Emirates Stadium, Arsenal took on Hull City in an FA Cup third-round tie. The Tigers had a gameplan to frustrate the home side, but it was not enough to keep them at bay.

The Gunners were in control from the start and nearly took the lead in the opening minutes when Theo Walcott’s shot rattled the crossbar. Hull goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic then pulled off a couple of good saves to keep his side in the game.

However, Arsenal finally broke through just before halftime as Walcott finished off a well-worked move. The second half was all one-way traffic, as Arsene Wenger’s side ran riot against their Championship opponents.

Mesut Ozil doubled the lead with a well-taken goal, before Olivier Giroud and Alex Iwobi completed the scoring. It was an emphatic win for Arsenal, who will now look forward to the fourth round draw.

#  Wenger confirms interest in German international Julian Draxler as club bids £24million for player

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has today (July 26) confirmed the club's interest in German international Julian Draxler, with a bid of £24million submitted for the player.

Speaking in a press conference, Wenger said "We are looking at Draxler, he is a player who interests us."

The move could see Draxler reunited with former Schalke 04 teammate Mesut Özil at the Emirates Stadium, with the two players having enjoyed a close relationship during their time together in the Bundesliga.

Draxler is one of Europe's most highly-rated young players and is currently plying his trade for German side VfL Wolfsburg. The youngster has scored 29 goals in 115 appearances for Wolfsburg since moving to the club from Schalke in 2015.

Wenger also confirmed that Arsenal are looking to sign another striker before the end of the transfer window, but refused to reveal any names. Marseille forward Michy Batshuayi is thought to be high on Arsenal's wishlist, but the clubs are yet to agree on a transfer fee for the player.

#  Mesut Özil nets opener as Arsenal beat Newcastle 1-0 to maintain perfect start to the season

Mesut Özil netted the only goal of the game as Arsenal beat Newcastle United 1-0 on Sunday to maintain their perfect start to the season.

The Gunners had the better of the chances in an open first half, with Özil going close on a number of occasions. And their dominance was finally rewarded in the 43rd minute when Özil slotting home from close range after a well-worked move.

Arsenal continued to control proceedings in the second half, but they couldn't find a second goal and Newcastle came close to grabbing an equaliser on a few occasions. However, Arsène Wenger's side held on to record their fourth consecutive win and stay top of the Premier League table.

Özil was once again the standout performer for Arsenal, with the German registering two assists and five key passes overall. He has now been involved in eight goals (six goals, two assists) in his last six appearances for club and country.

Here are three other things we learned from Arsenal's victory over Newcastle:

1) Petr Čech continues to be a rock between the sticks

Petr Čech made yet another crucial save for Arsenal on Sunday, tipping Ayoze Pérez's effort onto the post in the second half. The former Chelsea goalkeeper has been excellent so far this season, making 14 saves and keeping three clean sheets. Čech is proving that he is still one of the best keepers in world football, and he will be key to Arsenal's hopes of success this season.

2) Lucas Perez could prove to be a key signing for Arsenal

Lucas Perez has had an indifferent start to life at Arsenal since his £17 million move from Deportivo La Coruna in late August. But the 27-year-old showed glimpses of his talent against Newcastle, registering two shots on target and creating two chances. If Perez can continue to produce performances like this, he could become a very important player for Wenger's side this season.

3) Arsène Wenger's team are firing on all cylinders
