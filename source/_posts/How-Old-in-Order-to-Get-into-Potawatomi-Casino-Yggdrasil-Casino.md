#  How Old in Order to Get into Potawatomi Casino Yggdrasil Casino

In order to gamble at the Potawatomi Casino, you must be at least 21 years of age. The same is true for Yggdrasil Casino, which is the online casino run by the same company.

Wisconsin law dictates that anyone under 21 is not allowed to gamble in a casino, whether it’s a physical one or an online one. There are some exceptions though. For example, if you’re accompanied by someone over 21 then you can enter and gamble.

There are also land-based casinos in Wisconsin that allow people as young as 18 to gamble. However, these casinos are not associated with the Potawatomi or Yggdrasil brands.

If you’re not yet of legal age but still want to gamble, your best bet is to look into the offshore options. There are plenty of reputable casinos that will allow you to play even if you’re not of legal age in your country. Just be sure to read up on their terms and conditions before signing up!
