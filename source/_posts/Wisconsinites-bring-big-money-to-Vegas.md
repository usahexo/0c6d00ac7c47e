#  Wisconsinites bring big money to Vegas

What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas – or so the saying goes. But, apparently, that’s not always true. Especially if you’re a Wisconsinite.

According to recent reports, Wisconsinites account for a significant percentage of money gambled in Las Vegas each year. In fact, they often bring more money to the tables than residents of any other state.

Why do Wisconsinites love to gamble? And why do they seem to do especially well in Las Vegas?

There’s no single answer to that question. Some people might say that Wisconsinites are just lucky – and there’s certainly some truth to that. But most experts agree that there are a few key factors at work here.

For one thing, Wisconsin is home to a number of casinos and racetracks. That means that people in the state are used to gambling – and they’re comfortable doing it.

In addition, the weather in Wisconsin is often pretty dismal during the winter months. That means people are more likely to head to Las Vegas or another casino town in order to escape the cold.

Finally, Wisconisnites are known for being hardworking and frugal. That means they aren’t afraid to take a chance when it comes to gambling – and they’re also more likely to stick with a game until they win something back.

#  Wisconsinites Gamble More Than $100 Million in Las Vegas

Wisconsinites love to gamble. In fact, they spend more than $100 million in Las Vegas every year.

Most people think of Nevada when they think of gambling, but Wisconsinites are actually the biggest gamblers in the country. They account for more than 5% of all the gambling money spent in Las Vegas each year.

There are a few reasons for this. For one, Wisconsin has some of the loosest gambling laws in the country. You can bet on just about anything, including politics and sports.

In addition, Wisconsin is close to Las Vegas. It's only a four-hour drive away, which makes it easy for people to visit.

Finally, Wisconsin has a lot of casinos. There are more than 20 casinos in the state, and most of them are located near the Milwaukee and Madison areas.

So what do Wisconsinites bet on? The most popular bets are on sports teams, followed by casino games like blackjack and roulette. Some people also bet on political outcomes, such as who will win the presidential election.

 Regardless of what they bet on, Wisconsinites love to gamble. And it's no wonder - with all the casinos and betting options available, it's hard not to get carried away!

#  Wisconsinites Among Highest Spenders In Las Vegas

Wisconsinites are among the highest spenders in Las Vegas, according to a recent report.

The report, which was compiled by the personal finance website WalletHub, found that Wisconsinites rank fifth in the country for average spending per trip to Las Vegas. On average, Wisconsinites spend $1,533 when they visit the city.

The top four states for average spending are: Utah, New Mexico, Nevada, and California.

Wisconsinites’ high spending in Las Vegas is likely due to the city’s many attractions and amenities. These include world-class casinos, luxurious hotels, stunning restaurants, and vibrant nightlife.

In addition to being one of the top spenders in Las Vegas, Wisconsinites are also among the most likely Americans to visit the city. According to WalletHub’s report, Wisconsin ranks ninth in the country for states with residents who visit Sin City most often.

So what accounts for Wisconsinites’ love of Las Vegas? Some say it’s because the state is home to some of the best casinos in the country. Others attribute it to Wisconsinites’ love of gambling and excitement.

Whatever the reason may be, it’s clear that Wisconsinites enjoy spending time in Las Vegas!

#  Wisconsinites Bring Nearly $200 Million To Las Vegas Gambling Industry

The Wisconsinite gambling contingent is one of the most active in the U.S., accounting for nearly $200 million in spending at casinos in Las Vegas in 2015. That’s according to a report from the Nevada state Gaming Control Board, which shows that Wisconsinites account for about 2% of total gambling revenue in Las Vegas.

That may not sound like a lot, but it’s actually more than residents of any other state except California and New York. In total, Wisconsinites pumped nearly $1.4 billion into casinos in Las Vegas and other gambling destinations last year.

What’s driving all that spending? It could be something about the casinos in Las Vegas that just speaks to Wisconsinites. Maybe it’s the lure of slot machines and other casino games, or the promise of big payouts. Whatever the reason, it looks like Wisconsinites are happy to open their wallets when it comes to gambling.

#  Wisconsinites Fuel Growth In Las Vegas Gambling Industry

Las Vegas, long known for its tourism and gambling industries, has been seeing an increase in visitors from Wisconsin in recent years. While the reasons for this increase are not entirely clear, industry experts believe that the strong economy and lack of gambling options in Wisconsin are contributing factors.

The Wisconsinites who are making their way to Las Vegas are helping to fuel growth in the gambling industry. Casino revenue in Las Vegas has grown by more than $1.5 billion since 2010, and is expected to grow even more in the coming years. Much of this growth can be attributed to the influx of Wisconsin visitors.

There are a number of reasons why Wisconsinites may be choosing to gamble in Las Vegas instead of at home. The strong economy has left many Wisconsinites with extra money to spend, and the lack of gambling options in the state has made Las Vegas a more attractive destination. In addition, the ease and convenience of online gambling has made it easier for people to gamble from home.

Whatever the reasons may be, it is clear that the growth in the gambling industry is being driven, in part, by Wisconsinites. This is good news for Las Vegas, which continues to struggle with declining tourism numbers. The increase in Wisconsinite visitors is helping to offset some of these declines and ensure that the gambling industry remains strong.
