#  How to Output ASCII Blackjack Symbols 

In computer science, blackjack (or 21) is a card game played between the player and dealer. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by either obtaining a total of 21 with the first two cards, or by having the player's cards total more than the dealer's cards without going over 21.

There are a couple ways to output ASCII blackjack symbols on your computer. In this article, we will show two methods: one using Unicode characters and one using HTML entities.

First, let's take a look at how to create blackjack symbols using Unicode characters. On most computers, you can open the Character Map application. This application will show you all of the Unicode characters that are available on your system.

To create a blackjack symbol, open the Character Map and find the "21" character. This character is located in the "Miscellaneous Symbols" section of the Character Map.


Once you have found the "21" character, click on it and then select "Copy." Next, open up a text editor or word processor and paste the character into your document. You should see something like this: 

Now that you know how to create blackjack symbols using Unicode characters, let's take a look at how to create them using HTML entities. On most computers, you can open the Character Map application. This application will show you all of the HTML entities that are available on your system.

To create a blackjack symbol, open the Character Map and find the "₪" character. This character is located in the "Semiticblock" section of the Character Map.


Once you have found the "₪" character, click on it and then select "Copy." Next, open up a text editor or word processor and paste the character into your document. You should see something like this: 

As you can see, there are two different ways to output ASCII blackjack symbols on your computer. Whichever method you choose is up to you - both methods work perfectly fine.

#  How to Output Wilson as ASCII Blackjack Symbols

Adding Wilson symbols to your blackjack game can give you a distinct advantage over the house. You can use the ASCII character set to create these symbols, and they’ll be displayed properly no matter what device or platform you’re playing on.

The first step is to find the ASCII code for the Wilson character you want to use in your game. You can do this by typing “Wilson ascii” into a search engine, or by using one of the many online tools that are available. Once you have the code, enter it into your blackjack game where you want the symbol to appear.

If you’re using a software program like Microsoft Word, you can also add the Wilson character as an emoji. Just type “&wilsonsymbol;” and the symbol will be automatically added.

No matter how you add the Wilson symbol to your game, make sure that you test it out thoroughly before playing for real money. There’s no substitute for practice when it comes to blackjack, and adding Wilson symbols is just one more way to give yourself an edge over the house.

#  ASCII Blackjack: How to Output Wilson 

In this article, we will be discussing the ASCII blackjack game and how to output Wilson. We will also provide a few tips on how to improve your gameplay.

First, let's take a look at the scoreboard:

___ 
__ 
_W_ 
_I_ 
__ 
__ 


As you can see, there are two players – you (represented by the underscore) and the dealer (represented by the W). The goal of the game is to reach 21 (or as close as possible without going over) without going bust. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

If you have any questions about the gameplay, please consult our handy guide below:
















Now that you know how to play, let's get started! To begin, type in /blackjack followed by your bet amount (in dollars). For example, if you want to bet $10 on the game, type in /blackjack 10. Next, press enter to start playing.

#  Wilson as a Symbol in ASCII Blackjack 

ASCII blackjack is a two-player game where each player is represented by a black rectangle. The players take turns placing black rectangles on the board in an attempt to form three-of-a-kind poker hands. Wilson, the 14th president of the United States, is the only symbol in ASCII blackjack.

When playing ASCII blackjack, it's important to remember that Wilson is wild. This means that Wilson can be used as any other symbol in order to form a three-of-a-kind hand. For example, if one player has two black rectangles and the other player has one black rectangle and one Wilson, the player with two black rectangles can use Wilson to form three-of-a-kind.

The best hand in ASCII blackjack is four aces. This hand beats all other possible hands, including four kings, four queens, four jacks, and four tens. If both players have four aces, the player with the highest card wins. In case of a tie, both players lose.

#  The Art of ASCII: Blackjack with Wilson

The art of ASCII is a form of low-tech graphical communication that is often used in text-based games and applications. In this workshop, we will be using the popular game of blackjack as our example.

To start, we will create a simple blackjack game board. The board consists of three columns and nine rows. The first column is for the players, the second column is for the dealer, and the third column is for the cards. The top row is for the player's hand, the middle row is for the dealer's hand, and the bottom row is for the cards that have been played.

1     2     3
4   (-) 5 6 7 8 9
10 J Q K A


We will also need to create a deck of cards. The card values are as follows: two through ten are worth face value; a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points; an Ace (A) can be either 1 or 11 points. To create our deck of cards, we will first create an array of 52 elements. Then, we will iterate through the array and assign each element a value according to the above list. Finally, we will shuffle the deck using a random number generator.

var deck = []; // array of 52 card values
var i = 0; // iterator variable


for(i = 0; i < 52; i++) { // Assign each element in the array it's corresponding value deck[i] = {'value':2+i, 'suit':'clubs'}; }


function shuffleDeck(deck) { // Shuffle deck using a random number generator return deck[Math.floor(Math.random()*52)] }

You can now test out your game board by clicking on it below. To begin playing blackjack, click on either one of the player columns or on one of the dealer columns. A card will then be drawn for each column. If you would like to keep your current card, click on it again. If you would like to discard your current card and draw another one from the deck, click on "Replace." When you are ready to play your hand, click on "Hit" or "Stand." The computer will then do the same.

The object of blackjack is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If your total equals 21 or less (a "blackjack"), you automatically win unless the dealer has also drawn a blackjack (in which case it's a draw). If your total exceeds 21 (a "bust"), you automatically lose regardless of what the dealer has done.



		Below is an example game between Wilson and ACME Incorporated. Wilson was dealt an Ace and a two (A,2), giving him a total hand value of 3. He decided to hit and drew another two (2), giving him a total hand value of 5 (5). Since Wilson's new total does not exceed 21, he stands pat and wins his round against ACME Incorporated who had a total hand value of 14 after drawing three cards (14).
