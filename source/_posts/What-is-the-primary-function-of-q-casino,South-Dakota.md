#  What style of play is preferred by the team's manager?

A lot has been said about the departure of popular Manchester United manager, David Moyes, and the appointment of Louis van Gaal. One of the main topics of discussion has been the change in playing style that is likely to take place at Old Trafford next season.

In an interview with Dutch TV station NOS, Van Gaal outlined his plans for the team and made it clear that he favours a 3-5-2 formation. He believes this will give his side more width and attacking options and allow them to control games more effectively.

This new system could cause some problems for United's players though, as they will have to adapt to a different way of playing after spending the last 10 years under Moyes' more defensive approach. The players will have to be patient and learn Van Gaal's way of playing if they are to be successful next season.

This could be especially difficult for Wayne Rooney, who is likely to be used as a striker in Van Gaal's new system. He may find it hard to get into the game if he is forced to stay up front for long periods of time, rather than coming deep to get involved in midfield like he did under Moyes.

The main danger for United next season is that they may struggle to score goals if they don't adapt quickly to Van Gaal's new system. Robin van Persie may also find it difficult to play in this formation, as he is likely to be used as a lone striker.

It looks like United are going through a bit of a transformation at the moment and it will be interesting to see how they perform under their new manager next season.
