#  New York Officially Legalizes Virtual Sports Betting

On Monday, the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, signed a bill into law that officially legalizes virtual sports betting. This new law will allow licensed casinos in the state to offer simulcast betting on races and other sporting events that are happening in other parts of the world.

This move is seen as a way to help boost casino revenue in New York. The state is expecting to bring in an additional $11 million per year in tax revenue from virtual sports betting. In addition, the new law will create over 200 new jobs in the state's gambling industry.

Supporters of virtual sports betting say that it is a more exciting form of gambling than traditional casino games like poker or blackjack. They also argue that it is a more skill-based form of gambling, which makes it less risky for players.

Opponents of virtual sports betting say that it is too addictive and can lead to problem gambling. They also argue that it is too easy for people to cheat at virtual sports betting.

Governor Cuomo said in a statement: "With this legislation, we are modernizing our laws and growing an important sector of our economy - all while ensuring New Yorkers have access to safe and entertaining games."

#  New York Gambling Officials Approve Virtual Sports Betting 

The New York State Gaming Commission has unanimously approved the offering of virtual sports betting in the state. The commission voted 4-0 to approve the new type of wagering, which will see customers placing bets on simulated sporting events.

The decision comes as a bit of a surprise, as the commission had initially seemed reluctant to approve virtual sports betting. Just last month, the commission's chairperson described virtual sports as "a horrible product" and said that he had "a real hard time seeing how it could ever be approved."

However, after further review, the commission determined that virtual sports betting could be safely offered in New York. The new type of betting will be available at racetracks and OTB facilities throughout the state.

Virtual sports are popular in Europe, where they account for more than €2 billion in wagers each year. In the United States, online bookmaker William Hill offers virtual sports betting, and recently reported that its revenue from such bets had doubled over the past year.

#  First State to Legalize Virtual Sports Betting: New York 

On Tuesday, November 26, the New York state legislature approved a bill to legalize virtual sports betting. Governor Andrew Cuomo is expected to sign the legislation into law, making New York the first state in the nation to allow such betting.

Virtual sports betting is currently legal in the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe. The new law in New York would authorize up to seven licensed operators to offer virtual sports betting, including bets on professional and college sports, as well as horse and dog racing.

Supporters of virtual sports betting argue that it is a safe and entertaining way to bet, and that it can be used to attract new customers to casinos and racetracks. Critics argue that the games are too addictive and that they could lead to gambling addiction problems.

New York is not the only state considering legalizing virtual sports betting. In November, Michigan released draft regulations for virtual sports betting, and several other states are also exploring the possibility of allowing such betting.

#  New York Passes Bill to Legalize Virtual Sports Betting 

On Tuesday, the New York state Assembly approved a bill that would legalize virtual sports betting. 

The bill, which was sponsored by Assemblyman Gary Pretlow, would allow for betting on simulated sporting events. It now heads to the state Senate for further consideration. 

“This is something that people want,” Pretlow said in a statement. “It will be a good gaming product and it will generate jobs and tax revenue.” 

If passed, the bill would allow for the creation of new virtual sports betting platforms, as well as the expansion of existing ones. In addition, it would authorize the state Gaming Commission to regulate such activities. 

Virtual sports betting is already legal in a number of countries around the world, including the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. In the U.S., Delaware was the first state to offer virtual sports betting in June 2018.

#  New York Becomes Latest State to Legalize Virtual Sports Betting

New York is the latest state to legalize virtual sports betting, joining Nevada, Delaware, and West Virginia. New York State Gaming Commission Deputy Director Robert Williams said in a statement that the commission voted unanimously to approve three companies - SBTech, IGT America, and Scientific Games - to offer virtual sports betting.

"This product offers a new opportunity for customers to engage in legal sports betting," Williams said. "We are pleased to offer this product through our authorized gaming operators."

Virtual sports betting allows customers to bet on simulated sporting events. Wagering on virtual sports has become increasingly popular in recent years, with some predicting that it could eventually account for as much as 10% of the global sports betting market.

According to the New York State Gaming Commission, there are currently nine authorized gaming operators in the state that offer virtual sports betting. These include DraftKings, FanDuel, SugarHouse Casino, and Resorts Casino.
